Case Study 4 

Support Plans & Cost Estimation

My tasks in this case study were to estimate the cost of operations of using Amazon Athena to read SQL queries against curated datasets that resided in Amazon S3. The curated zone has been already constructed on AWS Glue DataBrew and ETL jobs and cataloged on Glue Crawlers. I was the Analyst in the Academic Department where I had to perform the querying daily based on gender retention analysis utilizing structured data through Athena. Since my project scope, I calculated 20 queries per day, in which each query runs about 2 GB of data. I did also set the capacity-based pricing with 24 DPU and the average of estimated 8 hours per month of a scheduled usage of queries. This setup had an option of Spark session part that could be added in the event of more sophisticated transformations. These expenses were assessed with the help of AWS Pricing Calculator and captured in the form of screenshots as a part of the financial planning and optimization strategy of the data analytics infrastructure.
