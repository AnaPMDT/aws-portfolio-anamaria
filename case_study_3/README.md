Cloud Service Models

An Overview of Service Model

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):
IaaS offers the resources of virtualized computer environment via the internet. It provides ultimate focus on infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage systems as well as networking. Examples of AWS E Lastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and AWS Simple Storage Service (S3). The model is very scalable, and it is commonly used to host a custom application or to store large amounts of data.

Platform as a service (PaaS):
PaaS is one that provides a platform on which users get to build, deploy and manage applications without having to work with the underlying infrastructure. It makes the development and the data transformation process easy. The most important examples are AWS Glue and AWS Data Brew. They can particularly be used in data analytics in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

Software as a Service (SaaS):
SaaS offers utilized applications in full management and accessible by web browser. Business customers do not deal with infrastructure or platforms. Zoom, Canvas, and Office 365 are the common examples of SaaS that facilitate administrative, academic communications, document processing, and learning management.

| Service Model | Description                                                                 | AWS Example                | Use Case in Academic Department                                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IaaS**      | Offers virtual computers and bare computing/storage resources.              | EC2, S3                    | Store and host documents and data of students safely.                |
| **PaaS**      | Provides an environment to build, convert and control applications as well as the data. | DataBrew, AWS Glue         | Process academic analytics, run data profiling, cleaning, and ETLs. |
| **SaaS**      | Provides an entire application to users through a web access.               | Zoom, Canvas, Office 365   | Control communication processes and course delivery and administration. |

PaaS and SaaS forms of service are the best service models of an academic department involved in the analysis of retention of students. PaaS provider, such AWS Glue or DataBrew, can enable effective data transformation and data wrapping, which can be crucial in the case with large datasets used in education. SaaS supports learning, academic communication and collaboration. When compared to IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are more effective in the everyday academic and research demands.
