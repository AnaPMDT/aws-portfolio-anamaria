IT Project Management viewpoint



The development of this AWS Cloud Foundations portfolio has improved my skills level on the technical aspect and the handling of data driven projects by scale in the small time of development. Employment in an academic environment as an IT Project Manager of such portfolio has improved my level of expertise in the academic environment.
Defining and creating cloud solutions, namely the data ingestion and transformation, monitoring, and governance, among others, allowed me to apply key AWS services in the settings of the project utilization. In all the case studies, I had an opportunity to exhibit systematic planning skills, seriousness to the stakeholders and delivery within the objectives and timelines.
Moreover, the portfolio enabled me to be more tactical in terms of cost management, data management and data monitoring performance that is the key component of driving digital transformation in learning organizations and technology-driven enterprises.
I could not have had my learning experience had it not been based on a level of hands on that I was subjected to which as well as stitching my knowledge base into the type of fluency that would acquire the technical expertise in cloud fundamental places also did support why this concept in the mantra of agile iteration, cross-functional collaboration, as well as data stewardship is one of the pillars of project success of IT.
